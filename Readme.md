# Loom Data Visualizer Engine

## Overview

Loom is a comprehensive data visualization engine designed to simplify the process of visualizing large datasets using D3.js. It consists of three main components:

1. **Loom Library**: A powerful npm library for data processing and visualization.
2. **Backend**: A robust implementation of data engineering that processes data for visualization with D3.js.
3. **Frontend**: A GitHub Actions-driven implementation using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, hosted on GitHub for dataset storage and on Netlify for UI.

Additionally, Loom provides downloadable versions of the frontend for various platforms, including macOS (.dmg), Windows (.exe), and Ubuntu (.deb).
