# Loom Data Visualizer Engine

## Overview

Loom is a comprehensive data visualization engine designed to simplify the process of visualizing large datasets using D3.js. It consists of three main components:

1. **Loom Library**: A powerful npm library for data processing and visualization.
2. **Backend**: A robust implementation of data engineering that processes data for visualization with D3.js.
3. **Frontend**: A GitHub Actions-driven implementation using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, hosted on GitHub for dataset storage and on Netlify for UI.

Additionally, Loom provides downloadable versions of the frontend for various platforms, including macOS (.dmg), Windows (.exe), and Ubuntu (.deb).

## Installation

### Loom Library

The Loom library can be installed via npm:

```bash
npm install loom
```

### Backend

Clone the backend repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nturing/loom.git
cd loom
npm install
```


## Usage

### Using the Loom Library

Import the Loom library into your project and start using it for data processing and visualization:

```javascript
const loom = require('loom');

// Example usage
const data = loom.processData(rawData);
loom.visualizeData(data);
```

### Setting Up the Backend

To start the backend server:

```bash
node server.js
```

Configure the backend by editing the `config.js` file to suit your needs.

### Deploying the Frontend

#### Hosting on Netlify

1. **Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify**:
   - Log in to Netlify and create a new site.
   - Connect your site to the GitHub repository.

2. **Configure build settings**:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`

3. **Deploy the site**.

#### Downloadable Versions

- **macOS (.dmg)**: Download from the release section on GitHub.
- **Windows (.exe)**: Download from the release section on GitHub.
- **Ubuntu (.deb)**: Download from the release section on GitHub.

## Self-Hosting

### Requirements

- Node.js
- npm
- Git
- Netlify account (for frontend hosting)

### Provisioning

1. **Clone the repositories**:
